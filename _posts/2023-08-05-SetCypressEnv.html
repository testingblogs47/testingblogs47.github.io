<p>To set up the environment for Cypress.io follow these steps</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Cypress.io requires Node.js 12 or later. You can download and install Node.js from the official <a href=https://nodejs.org>website</a></li>

<li>Once folder was created we need to configure our Environment variable as follows</li>

Define variable name as NODE_HOME and paste node.js path in variable value as below: 

<li>Download JavaScript editor to write a code, here we are using Visual Studio, anybody can download visual studio from this <a href=https://code.visualstudio.com>link</a></li>

<li>Create a new project directory or navigate to your existing project directory using the command line.</li>

<li>Initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command in your project directory:

<br>
{% highlight shell %}
npm init –y
{% endhighlight %}
<br>
This will create a `package.json` file in your project directory.</li>

<li>Install Cypress as a dev dependency by running the following command in your project directory:

<br>
{% highlight shell %}
npm install cypress --save-dev
{% endhighlight %}

This will download and install Cypress locally in your project.</li>
<br>
<li>Once the installation is complete, you can open the Cypress Test Runner by running the following command in your project directory

<br>
{% highlight shell %}
npx cypress open
{% endhighlight %}
This command will open the Cypress Test Runner window.</li>
<br>

<li>The first time you run Cypress, it will create a `cypress` folder with some example tests and configurations.</li>

<li>You can now start writing your tests in the `cypress/integration` folder. Cypress tests are written in JavaScript and have a `.spec.js` extension.</li>

<li>To run your tests, click on any spec file in the Cypress Test Runner window, and it will open a new browser window where your tests will run.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it! You have now set up the environment for Cypress.io and can start writing and running your tests.</p>
<p>You can also customize the Cypress configurations and explore more advanced features provided by Cypress.io.</p>
<p>For more information, you can refer to the official Cypress.io <a href=https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html> documentation</a></p>
